# Face Finder

**_Face Finder utilizes a machine learning API to detect faces in online images._**

This project was built as a part of completing my Complete Web Developer online certification with the Zero to Mastery Academy.

With this project, I learned how to use a third party Clarifai machine learning API. The functionality of the API usage interacts with a PostgreSQL database to store a user's interactions with the application. There is also users stored in the database with login functionality on the frontend. Please register an account with any username and password to access the live project!

Some of the tech used in this app includes React on the frontend, with a backend utilizing Node, Express, Knex, PostgreSQL and a Clarifai API.

Thanks for checking out my work! Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or to connect.
