This project was built as a part of pursuing my Complete Web Developer online certification with the [Zero to Mastery Academy](https://zerotomastery.io/).

With this project, I learned how to use a third party Clarifai machine learning API. The functionality of the API usage interacts with a PostgreSQL database to store a user's interactions with the application. There is also users stored in the database with login functionality on the frontend.

## Built With

Some of the tech used in this app includes React on the frontend, with a backend utilizing Node, Express, Knex, PostgreSQL and a Clarifai machine learning API.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library for web user interfaces
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Object-relational database system
- [Knex](https://knexjs.org/) - SQL query builder for JavaScript
